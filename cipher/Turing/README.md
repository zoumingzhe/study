# Turing: a Fast Stream Cipher

Turing is a Fast Stream Cipher developed by Greg Rose and Philip Hawkes at Qualcomm originally for CDMA.
After lobbying for 5 years, Greg managed to convince Qualcomm to make the use of this cipher freely available.

Unfortunately, the original links to the reference source code to Qualcomm's web site are now broken,
so this repository has been created in an attempt to try to preserve the original code.

The source code and PDFs found here were retrieved from [Internet Archive: Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web)
by digging through the following original links:
