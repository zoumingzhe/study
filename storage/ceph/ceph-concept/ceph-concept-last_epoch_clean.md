last epoch clean
================
the last epoch at which all nodes in the acting set for a particular placement group were completely up to date (both PG logs and object contents). At this point, recovery is deemed to have been completed.

特定`PG`的`Acting Set`中所有`OSD`完全更新（`PGLog`和对象内容）的最后一个`epoch`，此时恢复被视为完成。
