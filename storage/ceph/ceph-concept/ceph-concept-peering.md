Peering
=======
the process of bringing all of the OSDs that store a Placement Group (PG) into agreement about the state of all of the objects (and their metadata) in that PG. Note that agreeing on the state does not mean that they all have the latest contents.

使`PG`的所有`OSD`就该`PG`中所有对象的状态（及其元数据）达成一致的过程。请注意，对状态达成一致并不意味着它们都具有最新的内容。
